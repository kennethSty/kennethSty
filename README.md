## 👋 About Me  
I like building things. Especially if it involves GenAI and cool co-workers :) 

📌 **Currently exploring:**  
- High-performance **RAG architectures**, **Generative Modelling** and **Model Finetuning** 
- **Sparse retrieval** & **knowledge graphs**  
- **Causal ML & Probabilistic Graph Models**  

🔬 **Previously at:**  
- **QuantumBlack, McKinsey** – Developed a **multivariate demand forecasting model** yielding **7-figure business value**.   
- **German Aerospace Center** – Consulted on **causal inference & LLM overlaps** & with published research.
- **BMW Group** – Used Pyspark to optimizer BMWs Supply Chain in times or gas supply shortages.

✍️ **At the German Aerospace Center I also wrote about Causality:** [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/causality-in-data-science)
